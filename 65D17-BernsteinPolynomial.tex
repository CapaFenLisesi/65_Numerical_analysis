\begin{document}
The \emph{Bernstein polynomials} of \PMlinkescapetext{degree} $n$ are defined by
$$B_{i}^{n}(t)={n\choose i}t^i (1-t)^{n-i} \quad\quad i=0,1,2,\dots,n$$
where ${n\choose i}$ is the binomial coefficient.

Bernstein polynomials are used extensively in interpolation theory and in computer graphics. They can be computed efficiently using the de Casteljau's algorithm.
