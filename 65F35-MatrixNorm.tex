\begin{document}
A \PMlinkescapetext{\emph{matrix norm}} is a norm on the set
$M_{m\times n}(R)$ of $m\times n$ matrices over a ring $R$, and is 
usually denoted by $||\cdot||$.

The Frobenius matrix norm $||\cdot||_F$ and the \PMlinkname{matrix $p$-norm}{MatrixPNorm} $||\cdot||_p$
are the most frequently used matrix norms.

A vector norm is a matrix norm for which the ring $R$ is a field.
